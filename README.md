# Monster Slayer - Vue

As part of [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/), this project is meant to review and to practice every past lesson of Vue.

Since we are not using components _yet_, the code logic is a bit repetitive and everything is wrapped up into one single JS file, using the Vue CDN.

Those are the reviewed concepts that took part on this project.
